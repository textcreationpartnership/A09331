            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The diuell was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, God not beleeued: the apple was eaten, &amp; Paradiſe loſt: a miſerable choice. But led ſhe the way in this point of follie, and hath ſhee had no followers? What, none of her poſterity to walk in her ſteps? Behold the <hi>ſonnes of God</hi> choſe the daughters of men, and forſooke the generation of the righteous. <hi>Lot</hi> left <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and made choyce to
<pb facs="tcp:25671:3"/> dwell in Sodome: <hi>Eſau</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth his bellie, and for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meſſe of pottage ſelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his birth-right.

Yea, ſo mad are men in their choyce, as the Iewes from the higheſt to the loweſt, cry out to haue a rebell, a theefe, a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, euen a <hi>Barrabas,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of that iuſt one and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, Chriſt the righteous.</p>
            <p>As I haue ſtayed in my thoughts vpon theſe; ſo now ſhould I <hi>wonder,</hi> but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelues, I finde many as fooliſh, and as vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:25671:4"/> in their chuſing. They e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme more of pleaſure, then of peace wiih God: they will ſell godlines for earthly gain: they preferre profit before pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; worldly goods they like of better then heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: they chuſe rather to reſt vpon an idle conceit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of ſaluation, then vpon the witneſſe of Gods word, &amp; a truly informed conſcience; they wil plead rather cuſtom, then diuine precepts; mens examples now for liberty in ſinn e, rather then the holy liues of the godly recorded in Scripture: moſt, in a word, chuſe rather to be reputed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, then ſo to be indeed.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you (Ladies)
<pb facs="tcp:25671:4"/> will ſay, what of all this to you? Surely, that you behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nature corrupted, and your ſelues, through Gods mercy, ſanctified by grace, may in your more happie choyce, giue due praiſes hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily vnto God, who affoordeth you from aboue ſo much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and ſtrength, that you may in ſome meaſure with holy <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> walke in the Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Lord; with religious <hi>Mary,</hi> ſit down at Chriſts feet &amp; heare his word; with that <hi>bleſſed Virgin</hi> Chriſts mother, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the words, and lay them vp in your hearts; with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>Hannah,</hi> poure out in your neceſsities, your ſoules by

            <p>For this end and purpoſe, to further euery well diſpoſed Chriſtian, in the path that leadeth vnto life and glory; I haue now this third time publiſhed this <hi>Weeks work, &amp; worke for euery weeke.</hi> I haue preſumed to ſend it forth vnder your names, not in any merit of the worke, but in my true eſteeme of your godlineſſe, and certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of your good deſires to pleaſe God; which the Lord encreaſe in you more &amp; more with ſuch inward comfort of ſpirit, as you may perſeuere in

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25671:8"/> any certaine manſion; hither ſent of the Lord for a time to bee employed in his ſeruice, and ſo to ſtay till hee call mee hence; which houre I waite for, looking for death daily, and the Lords comming to iudgement. And therefore I deſire to bee ready prepared, and to learn whatſoeuer may be needfull both for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and encreaſe of grace in the way of life. Eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the world groweth ſo on to worſe and worſe; and this our preſent age declining ſo faſt vnto wickedneſſe; leſt I bee intrapped, and become guiltie of the common ſinnes, and ſo periſh in the deſerued plagues.</hi>

                  <hi>Alas (my Lord</hi>)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25671:10"/> 
                  <hi>this is our carnall ſtate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a fleſhly ſecurity, for the moſt part. For many haue a religion without the vertue of the ſpirit, and power of the word: they frame a God all of mercy, without terrour in execution of iuſtice: they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine a Chriſt without a fan in his hand, to diuide the chaffe from the wheate to burne it, and without an iron rod, to breake the wicked in pieces. But what ſhould I thus complaine of others? Oh that I could pray and mourne for them, and amend my owne waies, which verily I deſire; and therefore doe I humbly craue of thee farther directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how I may daily exerciſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25671:11"/> my ſelfe in true holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, that ſo I may auoid what is euill, and in the end find death aduantage vnto me, and the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the day of my perfect redemption.</hi>

               <p>(Welbeloued <hi>Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>) this thy heauenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, holy purpoſe, &amp; moſt gratious affection, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo happily to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doe cauſe me great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reioyce. It is a rare thing now a dayes, to find ſo humble a ſpirit in ſo learned a perſon; ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in ſo great proſperity: ſuch hunger and feeling of wants ſtill, in ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of grace. I know
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25671:11"/> not whether I more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire thee, then loue thee: both are ſo high in degree in my thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations vpon thee.</p>

               <speaker>Gaius.</speaker>
               <p>Reuerend Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thanke you for your vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued loue; but I cannot ceaſe to maruell, how my meane gifts and graces ſhould bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of ſo great worth with you; when I know, that of my ſelfe I am nothing, and haue nothing but of God; that more ſtrength of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in mee, then power of grace; much more yet to bee deſired, then I haue attained vnto, &amp; wherein many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands excell me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Iohn.</speaker>
               <p>Good heart, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25671:12"/> this thy humility, the Lord in mercy looke, and will exalt thee, as he hath promiſed them that are humble and meeke.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gaius.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God be pleaſed to ſhew me mercy in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I will acknowledge it his good grace without my merit. But may it pleaſe thee (thou holy man of God) to ceaſe to admire my poore deeds, and no deſarts; and with the eye of pitie to look vpon my great defects, and by thy gracious words inſtruct mee yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to demeane my ſelfe, that my wants may bee ſupplied, my preſent ſtate of grace preſerued, and by little and little, through prayer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25671:12"/> and practice, good things may by Gods mercy bee encreaſed vnto the end.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iohn.</speaker>
               <p>It pleaſeth me well (good <hi>Gaius</hi>) though not to ceaſe to admire thee, yet willingly to aduiſe thee (wherin I can) to the vtmoſt. Therefore for the preſent take this my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and aduice: thou ſhalt doe well to obſerue theſe rules following, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall courſe of life.</p>
               <p>Firſt and aboue all, ſet<note place="margin">Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules for the whole courſe of life.</note> God euer before thy face: thinke him alwaies with thee, preſent by thee, and earneſtly looking vpon thee, iudging rightly, and as thou deſerueſt, iuſtly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25671:13"/> to reward thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, behold his glorious Angels atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thee; perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of pietie, and all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; in well doing they doe guard thee; through wickednes they flie from thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, haue an awful regard to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, omit no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; commit no iniquitie; feare to offend in the leaſt ſinne, and be zealous of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery leaſt good worke; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme not lightly of any of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; iudge euery part of his will ſet downe in his word, worthie of all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25671:13"/> holy reuerence, and that with obedience in feare.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, and holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, abandon thine own will; ſhut out carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſeeke not thine owne glory, fauour, or praiſe of other in thy ſeruice to God; but onely reſpect his good pleaſure, and a conſcionable diſcharge of thy owne dutie.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, haue alwaies a loue vnto the <hi>Word,</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend eſtimation of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and a religious care to ſanctifie the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi> three things moſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually of a very prophane careleſneſſe, neglected &amp;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25671:14"/> deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, in what eſtate ſoeuer thou doeſt ſtand, take wiſely an occaſion from thence to become more holy towards God, to man more iuſt, and in thine owne heart more truly humble and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. If it be in abundance enioy thy wealth with thy brethrens welfare; ſupply their wants, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing freely, or lending in true loue. Thinke not thy ſelfe an abſolute Lord of thine own, but Gods Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who giueth, &amp; can take away; looke ſo vpon the poore, as on thy ſelfe, who may bee in their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:25671:14"/> ſtead. Make not riches thy hearts habitation, nor the power of reuenge vpon thine enemie, nor the prop to beare vp iniquity, nor as fuell to maintaine the fire of luſts, nor any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill whatſoeuer; but with thy riches honour God; doe therewith publike good, in maintaining <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, iuſtice, truth, charitie,</hi> and <hi>euery good way.</hi> If thou beeſt in honour, bee not puffed vp; contemne no inferiour, he may bee thy equall: preſume not to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize thy ſelfe to thy better; acknowledge thy equall euery where, as thy fellow: and to ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25671:15"/> giue then take honor from. Pride is hatefull, but true humility (not a baſe ſpirit) is a badge of true honour. For know this, <hi>that meanely borne are in place of honour euermore high minded, and of a more preſuming diſpoſition, with contempt of others, then the truly deſcended of ancient noble progenitors.</hi> In aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, of what kind ſoeuer, take it from God alwaies thankfully; bee quiet and contented, looke to the Lords promiſes; and vſe all good &amp; lawfull means for deliuerance; wait with patience; giue God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; iudge it thy deſert;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:25671:15"/> know thy offences; and ceaſe to ſinne. Euer being perſwaded, that thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate is beſt for thee, and moſt for Gods glory: and withall beleeue, that in the end thou ſhalt haue a comfortable iſſue of all thy troubles.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, liue to the world as a ſtranger, and as an enemie to thine owne corruptions. When thou ſeeſt other grow rich, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie not their proſperity: but if they bee godly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and praiſe God: if wicked, admire Gods mercy, and pray for them. Think that what thou thy ſelfe haſt, is more then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25671:16"/> thou well deſerueſt, or rightly canſt vſe, without Gods ſpeciall grace: the leſſe thou haſt, the leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thou art to make. Striue to bee well pleaſed with Gods will and his diſpoſing of all things: &amp; for this ende pray much and feruently; faſt often, but beware of hypocriſie: reade the holy Scriptures diligently, and that with all reuerence, attention, and faith: make them thy counſellours in all thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes; thy comforts in aduerſitie, thy guide in proſperity, and the rule of thy whole life.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, be much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25671:16"/> vnto heauenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, lifting vp thy heart vnto the Lord, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth ſpirituall eia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations vpon euery oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; <hi>though prayers bee but ſhort, yet may they pierce the heauens, by ſighes that cannot be expreſſed.</hi> If thou doe thinke of God, let it be with high reuerence to his Maieſtie: ſpeake of him with feare, as his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. So know him, as thou mayeſt in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him, neuer dare to diſobey his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Behold him in his goodnes to loue him, in his iuſtice to feare him:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25671:17"/> in his word to know him, and to beleeue in him. Behold him alſo in his workes, his <hi>wiſedome</hi> and<note place="margin">How to behold the Lord in his creatures</note> 
                  <hi>power</hi> in the workes of creation: his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>iuſtice</hi> in the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: his <hi>euer being</hi> in our continuall preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Acknowledge his <hi>prouidence,</hi> in prouiding for his creatures; his <hi>ſtrength</hi> in the mightineſſe of mountaines, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers vnreſiſtable; his <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi> by his Angels puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and his Saints piety; his <hi>inuiſibility</hi> by the aire and ſtrong winds; his <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous hand</hi> by the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſea; his glorious <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:25671:17"/> by the brightneſſe of the Sunne; his <hi>bountie</hi> by extending his goodneſſe to euery creature; his <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> and <hi>ſoueraignty</hi> by his rule ouer the world; his <hi>patience,</hi> by not ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confounding ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinners, yet his <hi>iuſtice</hi> in due inflicted pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments vpon others. His <hi>beautie</hi> by the heauens brightneſſe, the Sun in his glory, the ſhining ſtarres, the gliſtering gold, and the liuely colours ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his faire creatures full of admiration to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. His <hi>truth</hi> by the performance of his word; his <hi>ſtability,</hi> by the certain
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25671:18"/> and vnchangeable courſe of things; and his <hi>infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> by the earths round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the heauens circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and the immeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſpatiouſnes betwixt both. Praiſe this God in all his proceedings: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace none of his workes, magnifie his goodneſſe for the leaſt of his gifts: bee ſilent when hee croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thee: feare, when he is vſing vpon his children the rod of his correction: but tremble at his wrath, in his worke of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and euer ſubmit to the powerfull hand of his prouidence.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, in the next
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25671:18"/> place, with thy thoughts of God, ſauour alſo the things that are of God; <hi>that is,</hi> his word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, miniſtery and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie, alſo all diuine truthes, though aboue all reaſon; likewiſe all holy motions, preſſing downe the corruptions of thy heart; yea, ſharpe rebukes for reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſhew pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in bearing of wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, and manifeſt loue to the godly, though neuer ſo poore; and let their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thee bee more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the mightieſt, that bee enemies to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let mourning and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:25671:19"/> ſorrow for ſin pleaſe thee better then wicked mirth. Preferre Gods honor and diuine worſhip, before thine owne life, and al thy wealth. Hold it thy grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt preferment and glory to be a true Chriſtian, and a companion to all that feare God, profeſſing the truth with them in the way of life. Iudge it no diſgrace to bee noted for zeale in religion, for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the holy Saints in true deuotion. But deſire and ſtriue to bee like the beſt; follow <hi>Dauid</hi> in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie; <hi>Ioſias</hi> in tendernes of ſpirit, and a melting heart; <hi>Barnabas</hi> in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:25671:19"/> 
                  <hi>Nathaniel</hi> in ſinceritie, without guile; <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſpirit of meeknes, and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> in his reſolution to feare God, and that alone with all thine houſehold; and bee as <hi>Cornelius</hi> in his holy eſtimation of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, and alacrity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to ioyne with the people of God. Step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward euer with theſe and the like, in the way of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, &amp; that vnto the death, as holy Martyrs haue done conſtantly, &amp; looke to the reward of glory in the end.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, as thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; ſo bee alſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: ſerue God, and doe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25671:20"/> thy dutie vnto men: obey lawful commands of ſuch as haue authority ouer thee. Looke on God in the Commander, and for a reward at his hands. Be of a peaceable ſpirit: offer<note place="margin">Of our carriage towards men.</note> wrong to none, &amp; wrongs receiued, ſeeke not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: deſire onely that which is thine owne; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> peaceably, which other withhold wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; vſe law, but as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, and not as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger; hate no man, though he haue deſerued it; by loue win him, and by thy weldoing hold him faſt to thee: make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thy neighbour,

If in his abſence thou ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt of him, let it be good; and in his preſence onely for his good. Couet not to bee preferred before him; that is, pride: not to haue his life; that is bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cruelty: nor to ſatisfie thy luſt; that is filthie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtie: nor to get his

Though he diſlike of thee; yet loue thou him: faile not thou of any dutie, albeit other doe not obſerue thee according, as is meet. There is in thee, the more grace; and the greater praiſe thou doeſt deſerue, when thou canſt ſubdue thy paſſions, paſſe by contempt, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thy ſelfe, and teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men their duties one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thine owne weldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25671:22"/> as the thirſtie land. I preceiue heereby my great wants, and bewaile my imperfections. I ſee now the narrow way, and the ſtraight gate to life, and feare. Ah how much is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, how little practiced? I ſhould vtterly deſpaire of my ſafety, but that I reſt vpon Gods mercy, and relie onely vpon Chriſt his merits. Now the Lord vouchſafe mee his ſpirit, and the helpe of his grace, that I may be a true ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeruer of all theſe things, thus to doe his will, thus to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my bounden dutie. Oh (Sir) that I could in this manner liue towards God ſo in holines, &amp; towards men ſo righteouſly: Oh that I might
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25671:22"/> paſſe thus thorow this ſinfull world, with that peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, with that ioy of the ſpirit, with that preparednes for death, &amp; with that long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after our Lord Ieſus his comming, which is gotten hereby, and which the very creatures doe groane for, and all the godly true repentants heartily wiſh for. Oh how grieuous is it now to mee to conſider, how far I am from this practice of piety, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when I doe weigh my owne weakneſſes, and alſo want of grace to attaine to the due &amp; full performance of this ſo conſcionable a courſe? Oh what ſhall I doe? Oh what ſhall I do? I am ſo loden with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:25671:23"/> corruptions, and the world ſo full of tentations, compaſsing mee about with examples of wickedneſſe, that I feare my fall. He that ſeeketh goodnes, oh how little is he regarded! vertue wanteth praiſe, vice is not abhorred; innocency made a prey, iuſtice ſet to ſale; ſincerity reputed follie, and iuſt dealing is held the high way to beggerie. If yet for all theſe things I ſhould diſclaim the way of well doing, I ſhould therewith looſe the hope of heauen: if I ſhould embrace vngodlineſſe and vanitie, I am ſure to be damned in hell.

Conſider how<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25671:25"/> and opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thine eyes in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to behold the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light; for which mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy giue him hearty thanks and praiſes; and withall, deſire him to giue thee ſight to thy ſoule, as thou haſt light for thy body: and that as hee expelleth darkneſſe from thee, and affoordeth thee day light and Sun-ſhine, to the eyes of the body: ſo in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to bee pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue ignorance, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall darkneſſe from thy minde, by the light of his illuminating ſpirit, that thy ſoule by the ſun-ſhine of the holy Scriptures,

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25671:26"/> yeeres in ſinne, as houres in our bed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that after a ſleeping, though long, if there be life, there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a wakening: ſo is it with the elect, though they fall aſleepe againe in ſin, and lie therein a long time, yet becauſe they are not vtterly without the life of God, they ſhall at length awake againe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that as awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the morning by the day light, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time to ariſe, and men vp &amp; in health, there is not by and by a retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſleepe in bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; no more ſhall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:25671:27"/> death ſeaze vpon any, there ſhall be no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to reſt in the graue, in the day of the laſt reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that as a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full husband, aiming at his thrift, is aſhamed to lie ſleeping in bed, as if it were ſtill night, when the Sunne is vp, yea ſhining vpon him, and hee called to his buſineſſe: euen ſo ſhould euery good Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian carefull of ſaluation be aſhamed to lie ſleepiing in any ſinne, when the cleare light of the Goſpell ſhineth vpon him, and is called vpon by faithfull Teachers to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25671:27"/> of his duties.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, by thy riſing vp,<note place="margin">Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in riſing.</note> thinke vpon thy reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is twofold: firſt, from the kingdome of darkneſſe, and our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption, to the true light and kingdome of grace; and of the <hi>ſecond</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the graue, to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly light of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, in ariſing vp<note place="margin">Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our naked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neſſe.</note> without clothes, as naked; 1. conſider how naked we be by nature of all holines and righteouſneſſe, when wee come into the world, ſo to bewaile our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. 2. That wee ſhall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25671:28"/> ariſe naked at the laſt day, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. 3. That as in this bodily nakednes without clothes wee bee aſhamed, for the vncomelines ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to bee ſeene ſo of men, vnleſſe wee bee fooles, or madde: euen ſo ſhould we be aſhamed to be ſeen of God, of his Angels, and of any good men naked, without the couering of grace and goodneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the filthineſſe of ſinne. And as none but fooles and madde men come naked before men; ſo do none but mad men, wicked fooles, and men deſperately leaud, liue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25671:28"/> of goodneſſe before God, and his Church. 4. Think alſo, that thou ſhalt ariſe out of thy graue as thou doeſt ariſe out of thy bed, and ſo, indeed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in iudgement.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, being vp, &amp;<note place="margin">Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in putting on of our clothes.</note> putting thy <hi>rayment</hi> vpon thee, meditate of theſe things. That as thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt for raiment for thy body; ſo muſt thou looke for clothing to thy ſoule, which is Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. 2. That, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>hand</hi> thou canſt not aray thy ſelfe; ſo without faith, thou canſt not put on Chriſt. 3. That as <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily raiment</hi> is to couer our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25671:29"/> ſhame (and not therefore to bee proud of it) ſo is Chriſts righteouſneſſe for to couer our ſinnes. 4. That as a <hi>rayment</hi> fitted vnto thee, then doth thee good, affordeth thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, maketh thee comely, preſerueth thy body from dangers, which by wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king naked it might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with, and thy ſelfe brought to deſtruction thereby: euen ſo Chriſt his righteouſneſſe, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto thee, doth thee then good, affordeth thee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, maketh thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before God, and is thy preſeruation, to ſaue thee from the burning wrath
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:25671:29"/> of God for ſin, and other perils of deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which all that walke naked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it fall into, and periſh vtterly. 5. That, as when thy <hi>rayment</hi> is on, thou dareſt then boldly bee ſeene, and go before men; ſo hauing on this robe of Chriſt, thou mayeſt come boldly to the throne of grace before God. 6. As thou doeſt prouide a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering for euery part of thy body,</hi> &amp;, being able, doeſt beautifie thy clothes with other orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: ſo labour for ſpirituall graces to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part of the ſoule, and beautifie thy profeſſion with the comly orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25671:30"/> of good words, and good workes: adorne thy <hi>eare</hi> with the earing of attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the word, thy <hi>necke</hi> with the golden chaine of <hi>Peters</hi> Euangelicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; thy <hi>hands,</hi> with the bracelets of Almeſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deeds to the poore; let thy <hi>white linnen</hi> put thee in mind of inward puritie; thy other <hi>outward rayment</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſty; thy <hi>well ſhapt apparell,</hi> of decent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour; thy <hi>clenly going,</hi> of auoiding ſpirituall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe; the <hi>maske</hi> (to one of that ſexe) of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty; the <hi>long garments</hi> of chaſtitie; the <hi>mufler</hi> of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly ſilence; the <hi>fan,</hi> of

               <p>True it is (<hi>Gaius</hi>) that holy and ſanctified meditations afford, as it were, food to the ſoule, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

               <p>As thou goeſt to<note place="margin">Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in waſhing.</note> waſh, conſider, 1. that as thy body needeth <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſo doth thy ſoule of cleanſing. 2. That, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waſheth away the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:25671:31"/> of the fleſh; ſo doth Chriſts blood ſinne from thy ſoule. 3. that, as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou doeſt waſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wouldeſt bee cleane, and hateſt filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: euen ſo, in hatred of ſinne, and loue of puritie muſt we haue recourſe to the blood of Chriſt, that we may be cleanſed of all vncleanneſſe. 4. As thou haſt waſhed to goe to thy meat; ſo be waſhed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie to goe to the Lords Table.</p>

That as thou canſt not endure to haue thy garments duſtie, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, but will bruſh them, to haue off the duſt and filth, ſo ſhouldeſt thou not endure to haue the dirtie filth, or any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtineſſe of ſinne to cleaue vnto thee. 3. That as ſome ſpots and for incklings wil not off with light bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but need more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes, and therefore thou wilt vſe rubbing, yea and waſhing too; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the dirt will not out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

That as waſhed clothes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> need wringing, and alſo the warme Sunne to drie them againe, ſo needeth the penitent ſpirit, ſory for ſinne, and wrung with contrition, the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

That as without a <hi>glaſſe</hi> thou canſt not ſee thy ſelfe, no more canſt thou know thy ſelfe without Gods word. 3.

               <p>Firſt, giue thy ſelfe to<note place="margin">Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in returning home.</note> meditation vpon theſe things, 1. That as the <hi>end of the day</hi> cuts off thy worldly buſineſſe abroad, and cauſeth thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:25671:57"/> home; euen ſo the worlds end ſhall cut off all earthly buſineſſes, and bring vs to our euerlaſting home. 2. That as <hi>the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sunne,</hi> and the darkneſſe of the night co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering vs, doth make vs, that we cannot follow our callings abroad; euen ſo, by the declining of Gods grace, the loſſe of the light of truth, blindneſſe and darke errour poſſeſſing vs, wee cannot follow the workes of pietie, nor doe the duties of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. 3. That as after thy long <hi>trauel and abſence from home,</hi> yet thou doeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne again; euen ſo, there
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:25671:57"/> is a time comming, when thou muſt, though heere ſtaied very long, returne to thy home, thy euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting manſion. 4. That as thy houſe, being faire and<note place="margin">Heauen.</note> pleaſant, they alſo which liue in it, louely, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ioyfull at thy comming, doe much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce thy heart to enter in, and to ſit downe with them, hauing ſuſtained much trouble abroad; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo, may it be great ioy to vs, after this miſerable life ended, to enter into heauen, into that pleaſant Paradiſe, and to ſit downe among that louely, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ioyfull company
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:25671:58"/> of elect men and Angels. And on the contrary, as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing had pleaſures, honour, and all content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abroad, returning home, to a filthy houſe,<note place="margin">Hell.</note> the people in it moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them but wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; the puniſhments thereof, woes, miſeries, &amp; much lamentations, as ſuch a man, I ſay, would be exceedingly caſt down to thinke that he muſt goe to ſuch a home; and it would be as bitter to him as death, to enter into his houſe; euen ſo will it bee to all ſuch as here liue in this world full of honour,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:25671:58"/> pleaſures and riches, with all fleſhly and carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they muſt needs goe to their home, euen hell, the harbour for all thoſe that liue and die irrepentantly, there to bee tormented with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and his Angels for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, being entred<note place="margin">Another duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet downe.</note> into thy houſe and ſet downe, then call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance what God hath done for thee; what mercies hee hath ſhewed, what benefits beſtowed, what friends raiſed, what comforts affoorded, and ſo forth. And againe on the other ſide, what euils
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:25671:59"/> preuented, what dangers auoided, how peaceably continued and preſerued, and ſuch like, that ſo the Lord for them may bee moſt worthilie magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Conſider what thou haſt done, what duties performed, to ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of grace, what duties omitted, and ſinnes committed, to behold thy imperfections, and decay in goodneſſe, except thou repent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, after theſe<note place="margin">A third dutie at night.</note> things, take Gods booke into thy hand, reade it for thy ſelfe, &amp; others, if thou haſt a familie, &amp; conclude
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:25671:59"/> with prayer, and a Pſalme of praiſes vnto the Lord. And withall, meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>candle,</hi> brought for thee to reade by, that as thou canſt not reade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light; no more canſt thou vnderſtand without the illumination of Gods Spirit. 2. As the <hi>light of the candle,</hi> being in our eye but a little light; yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a great light to the whole houſe; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo doth that heauenly enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, though it ſeeme neuer ſo little to worldly wiſedome, yet doth it greatly enlighten vs. 3. As while the <hi>candle</hi> is light, we can reade, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:25671:60"/> it being out, wee cannot ſee: no more can wee ſee heauenly things, if once the light of Gods ſpirit be taken from vs. So likewiſe meditate, that the word is as <hi>fire,</hi> which thou ſitteſt by. The fire thaweth off froſtines, and expels cold: ſo the word melteth fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen hearts: it comforteth vs going to reſt; ſo doth the word, going out of the world: it trieth mettals, ſo the word doth men. It diuideth things, ſending ſome vpward, and leaueth ſome on the earth; ſo the word diuideth people, ſome ſending vpward, ſome leauing below, &amp;c.</p>

Thinke alſo as thou ariſeſt naked in the morning, and ſo returneſt to thy bed naked in the euening: euen ſo cameſt thou naked into the world and ſo naked ſhalt thou returne againe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in <hi>lying downe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in lying downe.</note> in thy bed, conſider thy <hi>bed</hi> as thy graue: thy <hi>lying downe,</hi> the laying of thy

Thinke by thy compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in bed, of the dead with thee in the graue; &amp; that two may be together, the one receiued, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſed.</p>
               <p>Conſider how, as a <hi>flea</hi> in the bed may bite thee, ſo the wormes in graue
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:25671:61"/> ſhall eate thee: as <hi>ſleepe</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away all care of the world from thee; ſo ſhall death in like manner ſet thee free from the ſame. And as thou doeſt not feare to ſleepe, becauſe thou art in hope to awake againe: ſo be not afraid to die, for that thou ſhalt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe afterwards to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as thou knoweſt thou haſt a ſoule awaking; though thy body bee ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: ſo know, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it thy bodie lie a while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe in the graue; yet thy ſoule euen then liueth and partaketh of ioy: let this be for thy comfort.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:25671:62"/>
               <p>Thus by theſe thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meditations, thy laſt thoughts being ſo fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon God and good things, before thou doeſt fall aſleepe, they will cauſe thee to lift vp thine eies to the Lord, to entreate him to take protection of thee, (for he neither ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth, which kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth Iſrael.) Theſe will preuent vaine dreames, idle fantaſies, and prepare thy ſoule to better cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Yea, thus graciouſly exerciſed, albeit thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt lie down to riſe againe in the morning; yet wilt thou ſo reſt ſecure, and lie downe without feare, as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:25671:62"/> one aſſured of life, though for this light thou behold it no more with bodily eies, vntil the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is euer therefore beſt to haue thy mind full of godly meditations, in betaking thy ſelfe to reſt: and it ſhall not bee amiſſe ſo to lie downe, as think<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing no more to riſe till the laſt day: the <hi>preparation to death, doth not any whit ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner haſten it, but maketh it more comfortable when it doth come.</hi>
